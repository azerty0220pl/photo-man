# PhotoMan
Photo Man was built with React, Redux and MUI as the final project of the third module of OXYGEN Academy's Fullstack Training. The design was made in Figma, and is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/oCCvhHtK622QIRdoEl2gXF/Proyecto3?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=ZP7TIptptZ2y6QrH-1).
